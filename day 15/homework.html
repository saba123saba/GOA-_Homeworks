<h1> html </h1>
    HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
    It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
    (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.

<h1> CSS </h1>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
    [3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility
    and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
    by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
    and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

<h1> JS </h1>
    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web,  alongside HTML and CSS.
    99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
    Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. 
    These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
